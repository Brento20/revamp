    <h3>Welcome to REvamp</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Traditional capitalism has done a spectacular job of convincing us that once something's broken, it's time to buy something new to replace it.<br><br>

REvampâ€™s mission is to create a highly shareable way to connect our community of fixers with new ways to repair, rebuild and improve everyday things in their lives.<br>


Why throw it out when you can fix it? 
And how can I make something better?
